Case 1: recovery is the best.
	 Other solution require the time to calculate own models. Still, i think that in real cases modelling takes more time than just saving the back-ups in RAM or just killing the process. So, in cases, when time cannot be just granted (actually, always) but solution has to be provided, recovery is the best way 
	 
Case 2: prevention is the best.
	Since it has more chances to be calculated, i think it's the best solution: 
	it doesn't stop and reset the processes, as recovery does; 
	it doesn't need to know, how the processes will work as avoidance needs.
	
Case 3: avoidance is the best.
	In cases of available information about the work of process, avoidance (via modelling) can be the best way: it's better to prevent the problem before it occurs, than catch it and try to solve. what actually to explain here step-by-step?
